CPC Image Customization Examples
================================

This documentation provides examples of the ways in which the base
Ubuntu cloud images from http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com can be
customized to suite the needs and requirements of cloud partners.

.. note::
    This documentation is not intended for use by end-users of clouds,
    but by cloud vendors themselves.  If that doesn't describe you,
    then proceed with caution.
